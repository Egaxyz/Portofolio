        I’m a fresh graduate and a junior web programmer passionate about
        creating interactive and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in
        using Laravel for backend development and Vue.js or React for frontend
        development. I have a strong interest in clean code, modern UI/UX, and
        building responsive applications that work across devices.

        I’m eager to grow in a professional environment and continuously improve
        my skills. I enjoy collaborating with others and believe that great
        products are built through effective teamwork and communication. I'm
        adaptable, quick to learn new technologies, and committed to delivering
        quality results in every project I’m involved in.
